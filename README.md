# raman_bournonite
ab-initio calculation of Raman spectrum of the mineral Bournonite
This repository contains the input and output files of a calculation of the non-resonant Raman spectra of the mineral bournonite.
In-particular, it contains the file qe_bournonite.json which conains the information on the phonon frequencies and eigenvectors that can be visualized with the phonon animation web-page https://henriquemiranda.github.io/phononwebsite/index.html.
